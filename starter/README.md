#### How to Succeed

1. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to layout the elements on the page.

2. Beneath the main image, there are smaller thumbnail images. Clicking on these will replace the main image with the selected thumbnail.

3. The tabs below the main image allow the user to switch between the product details, reviews, and questions sections. Clicking on a tab will display the corresponding section and hide the others. Enable scrolling for these sections.

4. Clicking on the star icons will display the corresponding review section and hide the others. 

5. Enable the user to close the modal by clicking on the "X" icon or outside the modal.


#### Extra Challenges

1. Enable the ability to add a review by adding an "Add Review" button in the reviews tab. This should display a form that allows the user to enter their name  and review. Clicking on the "Submit" button will add the review to the list of reviews. Store the reviews in local storage so that they persist when the page is refreshed.

2. Enable the ability to add a question by adding an "Ask a Question" button. This should display a form that allows the user to enter their name and question. Clicking on the "Submit" button will add the question to the list of questions. Store the questions in local storage so that they persist when the page is refreshed.

3. Enable the ability to respond to a question by adding a "Respond" button to each question. This should display a form that allows the user to enter their name and response. Clicking on the "Submit" button will add the response to the list of responses. Store the responses in local storage so that they persist when the page is refreshed.

4. Enable functionality for the "Save to a List" button. This should display a form that allows the user to enter a name for the list. Clicking on the "Save" button will add the product to the list. Store the lists in local storage so that they persist when the page is refreshed.
